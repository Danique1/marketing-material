# Protection against fraud

Any business knows the problem of transaction uniqueness and its audit
trail that are revisited by auditors. Transaction on a Graphene-based
blockchain are irreversible and secure, meaning that the cost of fraud
is no longer pushed onto the shoulders of the business.

# Fast and distributed transaction processing that scales

A Graphene-based blockchain can execute many thousands of transactions
every second in a distributed network, yet reach consensus about your
business logic. In contrast to other blockchain systems, Graphene is
capable of confirming your transactions in single digit seconds.

# Multi-signature and accounts

Graphene blockchains make use of an account-based transaction
processing. This means, participants obtain a named account and can use
it like an email address. Thanks to multi-signature, accounts can be
secured in a way that requires multiple people to approve a transaction
before it becomes valid.

# Accounting transparency

Many organizations are required to produce accounting documents about
their activity. Using a Graphene-based blockchains allows you to offer
the highest level of transparency since you can provide information to
verify balances and transactions through the block chain. For example,
non-profit organizations can allow the public to see how much they
receive in donations.
