# Smart, secure and decentralized

Blockchain technology is the technology of the future and provides a
trust-less platform without the need for a middle man; security through
cryptography and time stamps; and is decentralized which prevents a
single point of failure.

# What is Blockchain

Blockchain, also known as distributed ledger technology allows a network
of users to keep a record of transactions. In layman's terms, a
blockchain is like an “excel sheet” where each column and row (blocks)
have records (words, numbers or whatever you put into an excel sheet)
recorded. However unlike normal excel sheets and databases, this one is
distributed meaning that it runs across multiple nodes (computers) and
for a new block to be added, all the nodes have to agree or come to a
consensus!

# Blockchain Technologies For Business

Graphene is an open source collaborative effort created to advance
cross-industry blockchain technologies. It is a global collaboration,
including leaders in finance, banking, IoT, supply chain, manufacturing
and technology.

# Get started with Graphene

Graphene uses peer-to-peer technology to operate businesses autonomously
with no central authority. Transactions with instructions to the
business logic are carried out collectively by the entire network.
Graphene is open-source; its design is public and everyone can take
part. Through many of its unique properties, Graphene allows exciting
uses of Blockchain Technology that could not exist previously including
such as BitShares, Steem, PeerPlays, Muse and others.
